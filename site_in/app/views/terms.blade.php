                This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and MSNGR concerning
                its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If
                any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
                reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent possible so as to
                affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force
                and effect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of India

                for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not
                apply to this Agreement. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. You may

                written consent and any such attempt is void. The relationship between MSNGR and you
                is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This
                Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                assigns of the parties hereto.
